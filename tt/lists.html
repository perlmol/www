<h1>PerlMol - Mailing Lists</h1> 

<p>Since the project is just starting and there's not a lot of traffic, there
is only one mailing list: <em>perlmol-user</em>. If the traffic increases, the
list may be split into a developers list, a users lists, and maybe an
anouncements list.

<p><b>perlmol-user</b>: 
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/perlmol-user">[subscribe</a>
| <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=perlmol-user">archive</a> ]

<h2>Privacy notice</h2>

<p>Your email address will only be visible to the list manager (and probably
SourceForge.net staff). It will also be visible to other subscribers if you
send a message, of course. The message archive is available in the link given
above, but all email addresses are removed, so don't worry about spambots
harvesting your email.
