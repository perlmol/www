<h1>PerlMol - Download and Installation</h1> 

<p>The PerlMol modules are being developed for perl 5.8.x and are known to work
under Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and OS X. They are backward-compatible
with perl 5.6.x, but you are strongly encouraged to upgrade to [% perl_version
%] because support for older versions may be removed in the future. PerlMol
depends on other modules available on CPAN, such as Math::VectorReal. See the
README files for details.

<p>There are three main ways of installing the PerlMol modules:

<ol>

<li><a href="#cpan">Automated installation using the CPAN.pm module</a> -
recommended way for UNIX-compatible systems.

<li><a href="#bundle">Manual install of the PerlMol bundle</a> - alternative
way if CPAN.pm is not an option for some reason.

<li><a href="#ppm">PPM package for Windows ActivePerl 5.8</a> - easiest way of
installing under Windows.

<li><a href="#cvs">CVS Repository</a> - for developers that know what they are
doing and are interested in trying the latest unreleased development versions.

</ol>

<a name="cpan"></a>
<h2>Automated installation via CPAN.pm</h2>

<p>If you have the CPAN module configured properly, you can install each module
separately by using <code>perl -MCPAN -e 'install Chemistry::Mol'</code> (to
give an example). To install the latest bundle do <code>perl -MCPAN -e 'install
PerlMol'</code>. <strong>But note that some of the most recent modules may not
be included in the bundle yet.</strong>

<p>You can also download the tarballs for individual modules and install them
yourself by following the instructions on the README files, either from <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~itub/">CPAN</a> or from <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=106995">SourceForge.net</a>.

<a name="bundle"></a>
<h2>PerlMol bundle - manual installation</h2>

<p>If you don't have or can't get the CPAN module configured and/or you want to
install everything as one bundle instead of module by module, follow these
instructions (this works for Unix-like systems, including Cygwin and OS X, and
for ActivePerl under Windows):</p>

<ol> 

<li>Get the latest version of the PerlMol bundle. <strong>Note that some
of the most recent modules may not be included in the bundle yet.</strong>

    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perlmol/">CPAN</a>
    <li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/perlmol/PerlMol-[% version %].tar.gz?download">SourceForge.net</a>
    </ul>
<li>Untar it in a temporary directory and change to that directory:
<pre>
tar xvzf PerlMol-[% version %].tar.gz
cd PerlMol-[% version %]
</pre>
<li>Build and install the modules:
<pre>
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
</pre>
</ol>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are using ActivePerl/Windows, you may have to
install and use nmake instead of make. Or see the next section for how to
install using PPM.

<p>The last step may require root or administrator access. If you don't have it
or you prefer to install everything in your home directory, you can use
<code>perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/<i>my_username</i></code> or something like
that. In that case you also need to make sure that perl knows how to find the
modules by adding the installation directory to your include path. Add these to
your profile (.bashrc, .cshrc, etc.)

<pre>
# for sh, bash, ksh, etc.
PERL5LIB=/home/<i>my_username</i>/lib/perl5/site_perl/<i>perl_version</i>
export PERL5LIB

# for example:
PERL5LIB=/home/ivan/lib/perl5/site_perl/[% perl_version %]
export PERL5LIB

# for csh, tcsh
setenv PERL5LIB /home/<i>my_username</i>/lib/perl5/site_perl/<i>perl_version</i>

# for example:
setenv PERL5LIB /home/ivan/lib/perl5/site_perl/[% perl_version %]
</pre>

<a name="ppm"></a>
<h2>PPM Package for Windows/ActivePerl</h2>

<p>The easiest way of installing PerlMol if you are using ActivePerl for
Windows is to use PPM. Note, however, that several of the PerlMol modules in
the official ActiveState repositories are outdated or built incorrectly, so
don't use them or use them at your own risk! 

<p>The PerlMol bundle (but not the separate modules) is available as a ppm
package for Perl 5.8.x on CPAN; to install it do the following:

<pre>
ppm
install http://cpan.org/authors/id/I/IT/ITUB/ppm/PerlMol-[% ppd_version %].ppd
</pre>

<p>Perl 5.6 PPM packages are not supplied or supported.

<h2>A note about Perl versions</h2>

<p>If you have perl-5.8.0 or more recent, the PerlMol bundle has everything you
need. If you have an earlier version of Perl, you will need these additional
modules (which are included with perl-5.8.0):</p>

<pre>
    Test::Simple        0.45
    Scalar::Util        1.07
    Storable            2.04
    Text::Balanced      1.89
</pre>

<a name="cvs"></a>
<h2>CVS (development version)</h2>

<p>If you are interested in helping develop PerlMol or you want to take
a look at the latest developments, you can take a look at the
<abbr title="Concurrent Versions System">CVS</abbr> repository, either
through the <a href="http://cvs.perlmol.org/viewcvs.py/perlmol/">ViewCVS</a>
web interface, or through any CVS client. To connect anonymously using
the command-line CVS client, use the following commands:

<pre>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.perlmol.org:/cvsroot/perlmol login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.perlmol.org:/cvsroot/perlmol co <em>modulename</em>
</pre>

<p>Where <em>modulename</em> corresponds to one of the CPAN distribution names,
in all lowercase (for example, <em>chemistry-mol</em>), or <em>all</em> to 
get all the CVS modules at once.
