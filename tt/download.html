<h1>PerlMol - Download and Installation</h1> 

<p>The PerlMol modules are being developed for perl 5.8.x, but it should also
work with 5.6.x. They depend on other modules from CPAN, such as
Math::VectorReal. See the README files for details.

<p>If you have the CPAN module configured properly, you can install each module
separately by using <code>perl -MCPAN -e 'install Chemistry::Mol'</code> (to
give an example).

<p>You can also download the tarballs and install them yourself by following
the instructions on the README files, either from
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~itub/">CPAN</a> or from 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=106995">SourceForge.net</a>.

<h2>PerlMol bundle</h2>

<p>If you don't have or can't get the CPAN module configured and/or you want to
install everything as one bundle instead of module by module, follow these
instructions (this works for Unix-like systems, including Cygwin.):</p>

<ol> 

<li>Get the latest version of the PerlMol bundle. <strong>Note that some
of the most recent modules may not yet be included in the bundle.</strong>

    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perlmol/">CPAN</a>
    <li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/perlmol/PerlMol-[% version %].tar.gz?download">SourceForge.net</a>
    </ul>
<li>Untar it in a temporary directory and change to that directory:
<pre>
tar xvzf PerlMol-[% version %].tar.gz
cd PerlMol-[% version %]
</pre>
<li>Build and install the modules:
<pre>
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
</pre>
</ol>

<p>The last step may require root or administrator access. If you don't have it
or you prefer to install everything in your home directory, you can use
<code>perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/<i>my_username</i></code> or something like
that. In that case you also need to make sure that perl knows how to find the
modules by adding the installation directory to your include path. Add these to
your profile (.bashrc, .cshrc, etc.)

<pre>
# for sh, bash, ksh, etc.
PERL5LIB=/home/<i>my_username</i>/lib/perl5/site_perl/<i>perl_version</i>
export PERL5LIB

# for example:
PERL5LIB=/home/ivan/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.4
export PERL5LIB

# for csh, tcsh
setenv PERL5LIB /home/<i>my_username</i>/lib/perl5/site_perl/<i>perl_version</i>

# for example:
setenv PERL5LIB /home/ivan/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.4
</pre>

<h2>A note about Perl versions</h2>

<p>If you have perl-5.8.0 or more recent, the PerlMol bundle has everything you
need. If you have an earlier version of Perl, you will need these additional
modules (which are included with perl-5.8.0):</p>

<pre>
    Test::Simple        0.45
    Scalar::Util        1.07
    Storable            2.04
    Text::Balanced      1.89
</pre>

<h2>CVS (development version)</h2>

<p>If you are interested in helping develop PerlMol or you want to take
a look at the latest developments, you can take a look at the
<abbr title="Concurrent Versions System">CVS</abbr> repository, either
through the <a href="http://cvs.perlmol.org/viewcvs.py/perlmol/">ViewCVS</a>
web interface, or through any CVS client. To connect anonymously using
the command-line CVS client, use the following commands:

<pre>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.perlmol.org:/cvsroot/perlmol login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.perlmol.org:/cvsroot/perlmol co <em>modulename</em>
</pre>

<p>Where <em>modulename</em> corresponds to one of the CPAN distribution names,
in all lowercase (for example, <em>chemistry-mol</em>), or <em>all</em> to 
get all the CVS modules at once.
